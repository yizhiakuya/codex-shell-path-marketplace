# Codex Shell Path Marketplace

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A Git marketplace for `codex-shell-path-manager`, a Codex plugin that helps Windows Codex Desktop
agents start in Git Bash instead of the native Windows PowerShell shell.

This repository packages a maintenance plugin, not a replacement for Codex Desktop. The plugin
builds a patched `codex.exe`, configures Desktop to start that patched CLI through
`CODEX_CLI_PATH`, and writes `[windows].shell_path` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Status

This is a community workaround for Windows shell selection. It is useful while upstream Codex does
not expose a stable built-in `windows.shell_path` setting.

Related upstream discussion:

- <https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16579>
- <https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/27390>

If upstream Codex later ships this feature, prefer the official implementation.

## Install The Marketplace

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/yizhiakuya/codex-shell-path-marketplace --ref main
codex plugin add codex-shell-path-manager@codex-shell-path
```

The marketplace manifest lives at:

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
```

## Use The Plugin

After installing the plugin, start a new Codex thread and ask:

```text
Use codex-shell-path-manager to repair my Codex Git Bash shell setup.
```

The skill will guide Codex to run the bundled scripts.

You can also run the scripts directly from the installed plugin cache or from this repository:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\install.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\verify.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\rollback.ps1
```

Print script help:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\install.ps1 -Help
```

## What Install Does

`install.ps1`:

1. Finds Git Bash from `-BashPath`, `CODEX_GIT_BASH_PATH`, common Git for Windows paths, or `PATH`.
2. Installs Git for Windows with `winget install Git.Git` if Git Bash is missing, unless
   `-SkipGitInstall` is used.
3. Clones `https://github.com/openai/codex.git` into `~/.codex/codex-shell-path-manager/sources/`
   unless `-SourceDir` is provided.
4. Applies `plugins/codex-shell-path-manager/patches/codex-windows-shell-path.patch`.
5. Optionally runs targeted tests with `-RunTests`.
6. Builds `codex-cli` and copies the patched executable to
   `~/.codex/bin/codex-shell-path/codex.exe`.
7. Sets user `CODEX_CLI_PATH` to the patched executable.
8. Updates `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[windows]
shell_path = "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"

[mcp_servers.node_repl.env]
CODEX_CLI_PATH = "C:\\Users\\you\\.codex\\bin\\codex-shell-path\\codex.exe"
```

9. Stores backups and state under `~/.codex/codex-shell-path-manager/`.

The script does not modify the WindowsApps Codex installation.

## Requirements

- Windows Codex Desktop
- PowerShell
- Git for Windows, or `winget` so the installer can install it
- Rust/Cargo toolchain capable of building Codex CLI
- Network access for cloning Codex source unless `-SourceDir` is used

## Verify

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\verify.ps1
```

Healthy output should show:

- patched `codex.exe` exists
- user `CODEX_CLI_PATH` points at the patched CLI
- `[windows].shell_path` is set
- Git Bash starts successfully

Restart Codex Desktop and open a new thread after install or rollback. Existing threads may keep an
old app-server process.

## Upgrade

Refresh the marketplace and reinstall the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-shell-path
codex plugin add codex-shell-path-manager@codex-shell-path
```

Then run the installer again:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\install.ps1
```

## Rollback

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\plugins\codex-shell-path-manager\scripts\rollback.ps1
```

Rollback restores or removes user `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, removes the config keys added by install, and
leaves the built patched CLI on disk unless `-RemoveBuiltCli` is used.

## Repository Layout

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
plugins/codex-shell-path-manager/
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json
  skills/codex-shell-path-manager/SKILL.md
  scripts/
  patches/codex-windows-shell-path.patch
```

## Safety Notes

- Review the patch before running install.
- The installer edits user-level environment variables and `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- The installer creates backups under `~/.codex/codex-shell-path-manager/backups/`.
- This is a local maintenance tool. It is not an official OpenAI plugin.
